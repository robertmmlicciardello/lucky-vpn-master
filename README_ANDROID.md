# VPN Master - Android Development Guide

This Android implementation provides native VPN functionality alongside your web-based admin panel.

## Key Features Implemented:

### 1. VPN Service (`VPNService.java`)
- Native Android VPN connection
- Server management integration
- Connection status notifications
- Packet routing and encryption ready

### 2. Points System (`PointsManager.java`)
- Local points storage
- API integration for points management
- Daily check-in functionality
- Reward system integration

### 3. Payment Management (`PaymentManager.java`)
- Integration with your admin panel payment system
- Support for KPay and other payment gateways
- Transaction ID submission
- Manual payment approval workflow

### 4. Ad Management (`AdManager.java`)
- AdMob integration
- Multiple ad networks support
- Rewarded video ads with points
- Configuration sync with admin panel

## Mobile App Development Steps:

1. **Export to GitHub**: Use the GitHub button to export your Lovable project
2. **Pull the project**: `git pull` your project locally
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Add mobile platforms**:
   ```bash
   npx cap add android
   npx cap add ios
   ```
5. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
6. **Sync with native platforms**: `npx cap sync`
7. **Run on device/emulator**:
   ```bash
   npx cap run android
   npx cap run ios
   ```

## Android-Specific Implementation:

The Java code I've provided includes:

- **VPN Service**: Handles VPN connections with proper Android VPN API
- **Points Manager**: Manages user points and rewards
- **Payment Manager**: Handles payment gateway integration
- **Ad Manager**: AdMob and multi-network ad management
- **Proper Permissions**: All necessary Android permissions in manifest

## Integration with Admin Panel:

Your Android app will communicate with the admin panel through the API endpoints already defined in your project. The mobile app will:

- Authenticate users through your login system
- Fetch server configurations from admin panel
- Submit payment proofs for manual approval
- Sync ad configurations
- Report usage statistics

## Next Steps:

1. Complete the Capacitor setup as instructed above
2. Add the Android-specific code to your `android/` folder
3. Customize the UI components for mobile experience
4. Test VPN functionality on real devices
5. Configure payment gateways in admin panel
6. Set up ad networks and test rewarded videos

The code provides a solid foundation for a complete VPN app with admin panel integration!
